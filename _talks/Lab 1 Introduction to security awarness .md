**Project 1-1: Examine Data Breaches – Visual**

For my project, I chose to examine the data breach involving the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) that took place in May 2023\. TIAA is a well-known financial organization that provides investment and life insurance services for educators and other professionals. When I first read about this breach, I was shocked to learn that it affected a staggering 2.3 million people. What made it even more striking was that the breach was connected to MOVEit, a file transfer platform that is widely used across industries. The information that was exposed full names, Social Security numbers, addresses, and phone numbers—was not only sensitive but also life-altering for anyone involved.

Creating and analyzing this visualization gave me such a clearer picture of how serious cybersecurity threats are today. Reading about a breach in the news is one thing, but mapping out who was affected and what types of data were exposed made the situation feel more real. It was eye-opening to realize that TIAA, a company trusted by millions of people with their financial security, could be vulnerable in this way. That realization made me think: if large institutions can fall victim to breaches, then ordinary individuals like me need to be even more mindful about our digital footprints.

What excited me most about this project was connecting the technical details to real people. Seeing how one breach can ripple out to millions of families reminded me that cybersecurity is not just about firewalls, encryption, or IT policies it is about protecting human lives and their sense of security. A Social Security number or an address might just look like data on a spreadsheet, but in reality, that information is tied to someone’s future, their finances, and their peace of mind.

This project also made me reflect on my own digital habits. I started asking myself questions like: Do I really need to store certain documents online? Should I think twice before sharing personal information with companies, even trusted ones? These questions are not just technical they are personal. The visualization gave me a better chance of understanding that being careful online is just as important as locking the front door at home.

Overall, this project was a powerful reminder of the risks we face in today’s digital world. While the TIAA breach was alarming, it also fueled my curiosity and excitement about learning more in cybersecurity. The more I understand these challenges, the better prepared I will be to protect not only my own information but also to help others in the future.
